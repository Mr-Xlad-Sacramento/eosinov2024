  "original_prompt": "for the main site which is at eosifinance.org or on my pc is at http://localhost:5173/\n\n1.) Based on the 'header1' image:\na.) if you check the 'header1' image, you will see that i circled the an icon. the icon i circled i think doesn't give the site this riche luxury premium style look. i will prefer you switch to this other icon i used for my other sister site's platform as you can see the icon on 'sister site icon' image and how it appears on the sister site as shown on 'sister site hp' image. i have the raw files in the public/favicon.ico.jpg, so the name is 'favicon.ico.jpg'. you can resize it to be circle in shape than square it is.\nb.) the text i circled with red mark is not visible on the site, so best is to remove the text all together. We don't need it.\nc.) The 'Buy $EOSIF now' i think needs to be bit different colour and should give this rich, luxury, premium style design vibe or what do you think?\n\n2.) Based on the 'bad fit 1' image:\nthat place i marked with a green box, if you check, that 'Explore EOSI Finance' doesn't fit in fully to that curvy box which is very bad if you compare it to the 'good fit 1' image that fits in perfectly for how the 'Product Spotlight' fits perfectly in it's own box. i used the green mark box to identify or show you the box or stuff i'm talking about.\n\n3.) Based on the 'bad position 1' image:\nI think that it's not well positioned because it seems to be placed more at the lrft side than at the right side which i have indicated with those two separate markings to show how spacious the right side is compared to the left side.\n\n4.) Based on the 'adjust' image:\na.) i was thinking that the icon i circled green and wrote 2 with a red colour should be bouncing slowly while the one i circled green and wrote 1 should be circling. What do you think or which animination do you think will be perfect for it?\nb.) that 'Join EOSIF Presale' i circled, i was thinking for you to give it a rich luxury premium style effect.\n\n5.) Based on the 'footer 1' image:\na.) that down side i marked with red colour should be similar solution like task 1a and task 1b.\nb.) i think the 'EOSI FINANCE  |  PRODUCTS  |  RESOURCES' sections that i marked with green colour should be differentiated from the \n\n'\nHome\nTeam\nContact\nBlog\n\n------------\n\nSTANDR DEX\nBuy a Funded Account\n\n------------\n\nWhite Paper\nTokenomics\n'\ncolour and style indicating that they are the title of their respective sections.\n\n6.) Based on the 'standr homepage' image:\nI built standr dex site platform. Full suite hyper rich luxury premium site although i'm not yet done building it. it will be linked to the eosifinance.org site or now that i'm still running it locally, on http://localhost:5173/\nBecause i didn't want to bring all the remaining parts of that standr dex here, i asked codex 5.3 to extract only the standr homepage in such a way that i can export it to my 'eosinov2024' folder which contains this my eosifinance.org source code files. It did and i imported the extracted folder called 'frontend-pages-export' to my 'eosinov2024' folder.\nI then asked codex to go to the 'frontend-pages-export' folder to see how i built it and then try to recreate it for me with some little modifications. It did but there seems to be some unfinished stuff which we will be finishing soon.\na.) if you check the 'standr l1' image, theres many difference between 'standr l1' image and 'standr homepage' image. for example, the standr icon which is visible at on the 'standr l1' image while on the 'standr homepage' image, it's not visible or there's no proper standr icon even though there's proper standr icon called 'standr-icon.svg' located at 'frontend-pages-export/public/standr-icon.svg' . So it supposed to use it to recreate similar stuff like on the 'standr l1' image.\nb.) I don't like how the 'Join STANDR DEX waitlist' on white background and green colour is. it makes it look so cheap, quack and low quality. I was thinking if you can come up with something luxury on how projects, fintech sites, web3 sites always present their join waitlist notification there because how i made codex to build it is it will let users that click it be taken down to the section were they will have to input their email and optional x acct. so still like it like that.\nc.) that 'Explore Web App' and 'Open in Telegram', i will like you to make it in such a way that for now since i'm not yet done with building the standr site and it's supposed to have the link that leads the user to a new opened tab for the standr site, as well as the telegram supposed to lead to the standr telegram bot, but since these are not yet ready, i want that when a user tries to click it, it will indicate that it's unclickable with a popout notification for them to join the waitlist. the popout notification only appears if the user moves the mouse near the  'Explore Web App' and 'Open in Telegram' and if the mouse is moved away from these two buttons ('Explore Web App' and 'Open in Telegram'), the pop-out should disappear.\nd.) The Home at the Header should always take the user back to the main site which should be eosifinance.org but since i'm still running it locally for now, should be to the local host for example,  to http://localhost:5173/\n\n7.) i deleted some icons and images that i think we dont need and got this\n''\n[plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import \"./create-campaign.svg\" from \"src\\assets\\index.js\".
