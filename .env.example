# Frontend environment variables (Vite)
# Prefix any frontend-only vars with VITE_ so Vite exposes them via import.meta.env
# Currently this project has no frontend secrets — the frontend talks to the
# backend via Vite's proxy (/api → localhost:3001) and Netlify rewrites in prod.
#
# Add vars here only when you need to expose something public to the browser.
# Never put secrets or private keys here — anything prefixed VITE_ is bundled
# into the client-side JS and visible to all users.
#
# Example:
# VITE_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=EOSI Finance
